## Chapter 21: The Information Society  
### Objective  
To explore the concept and theories of the information society that rapidly emerged with changes in computer and communication technologies, and to examine how these new technologies have transformed human society.

## Content Overview  

The contemporary era is often characterized as an *information society*, where knowledge and information hold central value. Unlike earlier periods dominated by material or energy resources, today’s societies increasingly prioritize information as a key driver of economic, political, and social life.  

Daniel Bell observed that pre-industrial societies relied heavily on extractive industries, while industrial societies focused on mass production of goods. In contrast, post-industrial societies revolve around services, with information outweighing physical labor in importance.  

Politically, information societies are governed by structures often described as *technocracies*—systems where those who possess and manage vast amounts of information wield power. This dynamic highlights both the asymmetry of information distribution and the limitations of individual perception, embodied in the concept of the *technocrat*.  

Bell, in *The Coming of Post-Industrial Society* (1979), argued that new forms of information society began emerging in the mid-20th century. By contrast, Anthony Giddens suggested in *The Nation-State and Violence* (1985) that such developments trace back to the 17th century, implying that distinguishing between “industrial society” and “information society” is conceptually ambiguous.  

Alvin Toffler, in *The Third Wave* (1980), emphasized the transformational shift toward an information-driven economy and culture, framing it as a “third wave” of civilization after agricultural and industrial societies.

## Social Legitimacy  

The information society derives its legitimacy from the claim that information access and distribution foster equality, efficiency, and innovation. However, unequal access to information infrastructures also produces new hierarchies and exclusions.  

---

## Beneficiaries and Non-Beneficiaries  

- **Beneficiaries:** Tech corporations, information-rich states, individuals skilled in digital literacy.  
- **Non-Beneficiaries:** Information-poor regions, populations without digital access, developing states facing structural barriers.

## Mainstream Interpretation

The dominant scholarly consensus views the rise of the information society as both inevitable and transformative, but interpretations diverge regarding whether it represents a radical rupture or a continuation of earlier structural trends.

## Divergent Interpretations by Stakeholders  

- **By Country:**  
  - *Korea:* Views the information society as a strategy for national competitiveness, focusing on IT infrastructure, broadband penetration, and digital innovation.  
  - *Australia:* Frames it within debates on digital inclusion, balancing economic modernization with equitable access in rural and indigenous communities.  

- **By Discipline:**  
  - *Sociology:* Explores information society as a structural transformation of class, power, and social mobility.  
  - *Economics:* Treats information as a new factor of production.  
  - *Political Science:* Examines technocracy, governance, and power shifts.  

- **Security Integration:**  
  - *Potential Issues:* Cybersecurity risks, surveillance, data privacy violations.  
  - *Solutions:* Strengthening international cyber norms, enhancing transparency in information flows, building equitable access to digital infrastructures.

## My Reflection  

Throughout history, tools of stratification—such as language, industrial capacity, and now information—have always existed. In the information society, the central axis of power is access to information flows.  

What struck me is how geography influences these dynamics. Submarine cables demonstrate that landlocked countries often depend on coastal states for access, leading to slower connectivity and higher costs. This creates economic disadvantages in attracting foreign firms despite competitive factors like interest rates.  

Thus, technological change is deeply embedded in geography. Information, while intangible, still follows physical routes that shape the hierarchy of nations in the global order.
