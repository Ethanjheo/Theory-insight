## Chapter Summary (Brief)
The defining feature of the modern information society is digitalization.  
- Mark Poster, in *The Mode of Information*, argued that as information spreads, the monopolistic authority to produce and interpret knowledge weakens. In traditional societies, elites and clergy dominated knowledge, but this authority has shifted in contemporary times.  
- Jean-François Lyotard, in *The Postmodern Condition*, claimed that universities and intellectuals as traditional knowledge authorities are collapsing.  
- Jean Baudrillard, through *Simulacra and Simulation*, provided a pessimistic perspective: information society is marked by competition between fragmented levels of knowledge, creating unstable symbolic orders.  

## Social Justification
The transition into an information society is often justified as democratization of knowledge, enabling broader participation in discourse and decision-making.

## Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries
- **Beneficiaries**: Tech corporations, digital elites, academic institutions with strong symbolic capital.  
- **Non-Beneficiaries**: Marginalized groups lacking digital literacy or access, whose voices remain structurally excluded despite the appearance of openness.  

## Mainstream Interpretation (Legitimacy)
Prevailing interpretations emphasize the empowerment and inclusivity of information technology. However, critical voices point out that decentralization of authority is superficial, with deeper inequalities reproduced.

## Divergent Interpretations by Stakeholders
- **By Relevant Countries**:  
  - US: Frames information society as a frontier of innovation and market growth.  
  - EU: Stronger focus on regulation, privacy, and data protection.  
  - Korea: Heavy emphasis on state-driven ICT development for global competitiveness.  
  - Australia: Focus on balancing digital innovation with education and public sector access.  

- **By Academic Discipline**:  
  - Sociology: Concerned with inequality, symbolic capital, and knowledge authority.  
  - Political Science: Emphasizes governance, legitimacy, and the erosion of institutional authority.  
  - Economics: Frames digitalization as a driver of productivity and new markets.  

- **Korea vs. Australia (Past & Present)**:  
  - Korea: Transition from state-led digitalization in the 1990s to global ICT competitiveness, but with growing inequality in digital access.  
  - Australia: More gradual adoption, emphasizing integration into education and inclusive public discourse.  

- **Security Fusion Perspective**:  
  - **Potential Issues**: Information asymmetry, cyber inequality, manipulation of public opinion, concentration of symbolic power.  
  - **Possible Solutions**: Governance frameworks ensuring equitable access, digital literacy programs, and security standards preventing monopolization of informational capital.  

## Personal Reflection
While traditional universities and intellectuals have weakened in their authority, symbolic capital embedded in academic institutions remains powerful. The flood of unverified information dilutes logical coherence and increases the risk of shallow perspectives dominating discourse. This paradox strengthens the role of elite universities, as their symbolic capital becomes even more valuable in distinguishing credible knowledge.  
Moreover, information asymmetry intensifies as insiders consolidate their positions while outsiders remain fragmented. This implies that rather than democratization, the information society accelerates stratification under new symbolic forms of authority.
