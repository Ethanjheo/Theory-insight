## 2. Content Summary

### Perspective-Based Comparison

#### By Relevant Countries
- Developed countries view pollution as a regulatory and moral issue, emphasizing sustainability, environmental policy, and citizen participation.  
- Developing countries often treat pollution as an unavoidable cost of industrialization, with economic survival prioritized over environmental protection.

#### By Academic Discipline
- Environmental science approaches pollution through data, measurable impact, and technological solutions.  
- Social sciences examine how pollution reflects inequality, policy failure, and disproportionate harm to vulnerable populations.

### Security Integration: GRC Perspective

#### Potential Risks
- Mismanagement or tampering of environmental monitoring data could erode public trust.  
- Weak governance may delay response to critical environmental incidents, especially in politically sensitive regions.

#### Solutions
- Incorporate environmental risk metrics into national cybersecurity and compliance frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 14001).  
- Ensure integrity and transparency in data collection and reporting, with coordinated oversight from both environmental and security teams.

## 3. My Reflection

Environmental challenges cannot be reduced to technical problems alone.  
They are interpreted through the lens of national interests and disciplinary frameworks.  
While environmental science emphasizes the conservation of energy and long-term ecological vulnerability,  
a geopolitical lens reveals how environmental discourse may serve as a mechanism for developed nations to assert influence over developing ones.

From a security standpoint, environmental risk cannot be managed solely through technical controls.  
Collaboration with environmental experts is essential, and any effective governance model must account for the political dimensions inherent in global ecological issues.
