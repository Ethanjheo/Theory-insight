## Practice Essay

Environmental responsibility cannot be universalized without acknowledging global power asymmetries. While advanced economies often call for strict environmental regulations—invoking moral responsibility—they frequently avoid costly domestic reforms themselves.

Developing nations, in contrast, view such regulations as constraints on growth, asserting that poverty, not industry, is the root of environmental degradation. This divide reveals the limits of applying uniform standards in a world of unequal capacity and opportunity.

True sustainability must reflect not only ecological logic but also geopolitical realities and inclusive stakeholder participation. Without this holistic approach, environmental policy risks reinforcing the very inequalities it claims to resolve.
