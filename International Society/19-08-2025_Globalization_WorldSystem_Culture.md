## Chapter Overview
This lecture explores the concept, causes, and characteristics of globalization, with particular emphasis on its influence on human life. Two central subtopics are highlighted: the **World-System** and **Global Culture**.  

### World-System
Wallerstein argued that the world-system developed not at the national level but at a global dimension. American political scientist Christopher Chase-Dunn adopted a dual approach to globalization, noting that political logic remains nation-centered, while economic logic follows a global pattern.  

### Global Culture
The global culture theory prioritizes cultural aspects over political or economic factors. Critical scholars argue that the rise of global culture weakens national identity and cultural integration. However, many studies suggest that globalization leads to homogenization and standardization of culture.  

This process weakens national cultural identity while strengthening legal, civic, and local community identities. The increase of information flows has generated transnational hybrid cultures. Migration from the Global South to Western and North American regions has created ethnic enclaves, fostering cultural pluralism within national contexts.  

## Justification and Beneficiaries
- **Justification:** Globalization can be justified as a mechanism for expanding connectivity, economic growth, and cultural exchange.  
- **Beneficiaries:** Multinational corporations, highly mobile professionals, global cities, and cosmopolitan elites.  
- **Non-Beneficiaries:** Traditional labor groups, marginalized minorities without global access, and communities whose national identity weakens under cultural standardization.  

## Content Summary (Perspective-Based Comparison)

### By Relevant Countries
- **Korea:** Economic dependency on the U.S. limits autonomy. Political rhetoric may prioritize nationalistic appeals, creating a gap between global economic integration and domestic political discourse.  
- **Australia:** Positioned as a resource-exporting economy with strong regional ties. Australia leverages its Anglo-Western cultural base while integrating Asian-Pacific multiculturalism.  

### By Academic Discipline
- **Sociology:** Highlights identity shifts, hybrid cultures, and the weakening of national culture.  
- **Political Science:** Stresses state sovereignty versus global governance structures.  
- **Economics:** Emphasizes interdependence, trade, and systemic inequalities within capitalism.  

### Past and Present (Korea and Australia)
- **Korea (Past):** National identity emphasized as part of industrialization and state-building.  
- **Korea (Present):** Increasing hybrid culture through migration and digital globalization; stronger populist tendencies in politics.  
- **Australia (Past):** Stronger British-oriented cultural identity.  
- **Australia (Present):** Multicultural policies encourage diversity, yet debates over national identity persist.  

### Security Integration
- **Potential Problems:**  
  - Cyber threats emerging from global interconnectedness.  
  - Loss of digital sovereignty as data flows cross borders.  
  - Cultural conflicts amplified through online platforms.  
- **Possible Solutions:**  
  - Implementing cross-border GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) frameworks.  
  - Promoting digital literacy to manage hybrid cultural identities.  
  - Strengthening multi-stakeholder governance in cyberspace.  

## Accuracy and Coherence
- **Accuracy :** Supported by world-systems theory and global culture research.  
- **Coherence :** Aligns with broader patterns of political-economic globalization while recognizing cultural pluralism.  

## Personal Reflection
The capitalist world-system is altering the scope of state influence, opening pathways for populism. In Korea, dependence on the U.S. economy combined with domestic political assertiveness suggests a possible shift toward political primacy over economic logic. This imbalance may lead to contradictions between domestic policies and global pressures. Despite this, political actors may still rely on populist and symbolic language to secure electoral support.
