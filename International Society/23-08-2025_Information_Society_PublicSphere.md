## Chapter 21: The Information Society  
### Subtopic: Habermas’ Public Sphere, Herbert Schiller and Capitalist Market, Manuel Castells and the Information Age  

---

## Content Overview  

- **Habermas’ Public Sphere:**  
  Habermas emphasized that in modern society, continuous communication and information exchange enable the formation of public opinion, thereby creating the *public sphere*.  

- **Herbert Schiller’s Capitalist Market Approach:**  
  Unlike Giddens, Schiller highlighted the capitalist market, particularly in his 1984 work *Information and the Crisis Economy*. He argued that the information revolution was driven by corporate pursuit of profit, leading to the commodification of information. This process reinforced class inequality, as disparities in production, distribution, and access to information became decisive in reproducing social hierarchies.  

- **Manuel Castells’ Information Age and the Dual City:**  
  Castells, in *The Informational City* (1989), analyzed the transformation of urban environments through information technologies. He argued that the rise of *informational cities* created new managerial elites who dominate cultural and economic life. This resulted in stark polarization between impoverished urban districts and wealthy information elites, a condition he described as the *dual city*. The same digital divide, he noted, is reproduced in cyberspace.

## Social Legitimacy  

The legitimacy of the information society is derived from claims of expanding communication, democratizing access, and enabling innovation. However, the actual dynamics reproduce inequality by privileging those with access to information infrastructures while marginalizing others.

## Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries  

- **Beneficiaries:**  
  - Transnational corporations leveraging information as a commodity.  
  - Managerial elites in informational cities.  
  - Digitally literate populations with access to infrastructure.  

- **Non-Beneficiaries:**  
  - Marginalized urban populations in the “dual city.”  
  - Workers displaced by automation and information-driven restructuring.  
  - Developing nations with limited information infrastructure.

## Mainstream Interpretation  

The prevailing academic consensus interprets the information society as both a transformative development and a reproduction of capitalist inequality. While some scholars frame it as progress toward democratization and innovation, others emphasize its entrenchment of asymmetry and exclusion.

## Divergent Interpretations by Stakeholders  

### By Relevant Countries  
- **United States:** Information society framed as market-driven innovation, dominated by corporate interests.  
- **European Union:** Stronger emphasis on regulation, digital rights, and public access.  
- **China:** Views information society as a tool of state power and surveillance, prioritizing control.  
- **Korea:** Positions IT development as a national growth strategy, focusing on broadband infrastructure and global competitiveness.  
- **Australia:** Frames debates around digital inclusion, especially for rural and indigenous communities.  

### By Academic Discipline  
- **Sociology:** Focuses on class inequality, public sphere, and social mobility.  
- **Economics:** Treats information as a commodity and factor of production.  
- **Political Science:** Examines technocracy, governance, and the tension between state and market.  

### Korea vs. Australia (Past and Present)  
- **Korea:** Transitioned from industrial to information economy in the late 20th century; now emphasizes global IT competitiveness and 5G/AI leadership.  
- **Australia:** Later adoption of broadband; policy debates often focus on equity of access in rural and remote areas, with a stronger welfare-state framing.  

### Integration with Security  
- **Problems:** Cybersecurity threats, digital surveillance, widening information inequality.  
- **Solutions:**  
  - Establishing international cyber norms.  
  - Regulating monopolistic control of information platforms.  
  - Enhancing equitable access to digital infrastructures.

## My Reflection  

The information age has created prosperity but also deepened social inequalities. Historically, stratification has always existed—whether through language, industrial capacity, or now information.  

The asymmetry of information acts as both a barrier and a tool of control. Those within institutional frameworks can use information as an internal language of power, while outsiders perceive only its legitimizing “narratives.” This mismatch between *substance (실익)* and *appearance (명분)* reinforces exclusion and inequality.  

Thus, while the information society accelerates human connectivity and growth, it simultaneously redefines the boundary of privilege. Recognizing and addressing these contradictions is essential for more equitable development.
