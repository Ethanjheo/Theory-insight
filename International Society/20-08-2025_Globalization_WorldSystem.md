## Chapter Summary (Brief)
World-systems theory views the continuously globalizing capitalist structure as the dominant global order. It analyzes capitalism through three dimensions: the logic of internal systems, historical development structures, and specific social institutional frameworks.  

American sociologist Gary Gereffi analyzed global commodity chains, distinguishing between producer-driven and consumer-driven forms. Producer-driven chains emphasize integrated production systems, while consumer-driven chains rely on decentralized production networks.  

British sociologist Leslie Sklair highlighted the rise of transnational capitalist institutions and practices, pointing to the emergence of a transnational capitalist class, primarily multinational corporations.  

British geographer and social theorist David Harvey connected debates on economic globalization with cultural globalization, stressing that capitalism’s expansion is tied not only to internal dynamics but also to the collapse of Cold War structures.  

Although many expected communism’s collapse to bring about a unified system, global economic integration has instead accelerated instability and disorder rather than forming a single coherent capitalist economy.  

World-systems theory shares similarities with Talcott Parsons’ systems theory but evolves it in a far more radical direction, presenting paradoxes through the loss of integration.  

## Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries
- **Beneficiaries**: Transnational corporations, capital-intensive producer groups, technologically advanced economies.  
- **Non-Beneficiaries**: Developing economies lacking access to capital and technology, local industries overshadowed by global supply chains.  

## Content Summary (Perspective-Based Comparison)
- **By Relevant Countries**:  
  - The United States exemplifies consumer-driven chains through retail networks and global outsourcing.  
  - The United Kingdom emphasizes theoretical contributions to understanding transnational capitalism.  
- **By Academic Discipline**:  
  - Sociology: Global commodity chains and capitalist class formation.  
  - Geography: Spatial organization of global capitalism.  
  - Political Economy: The dual logic of global economic integration versus national political control.  
- **Past and Present (Korea and Australia)**:  
  - Korea: Historically state-driven industrialization, now highly integrated in producer-driven technological sectors.  
  - Australia: Positioned more as a resource-exporting economy, increasingly shaped by global consumer-driven networks.  
- **Integration with Security Perspective**:  
  - **Problem**: Global supply chains create vulnerabilities in logistics, data security, and trade dependencies.  
  - **Solution**: Stronger cybersecurity for transnational networks, international compliance frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST CSF).  

## Accuracy and Coherence
World-systems theory offers accuracy in explaining structural capitalist dynamics but faces coherence challenges in predicting stability. The persistence of disorder after communism’s collapse illustrates the gap between theoretical expectations and historical outcomes.  

## Personal Reflection
Globalization remains conceptually incomplete in capturing the realities of the information age. While cultures rapidly diffuse, they also coexist, making it difficult to define globalization under a single paradigm.  

The distinction between producer-driven and consumer-driven chains stands out. Producer-driven systems, though competitive and resource-intensive, provide greater long-term influence if mastered. Consumer-driven systems lower entry barriers but create fragmented networks. I believe focusing on producer-driven structures, despite higher risks and challenges, would yield stronger strategic advantages for long-term positioning.
