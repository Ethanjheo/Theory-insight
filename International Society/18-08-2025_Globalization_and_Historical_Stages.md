## Personal Reflection
Globalization has undeniably expanded opportunities for growth, communication, and cultural exchange. However, it also risks disempowering states when multinational corporations gain disproportionate influence. While globalization is indispensable for national development, it requires a careful balance between facilitation and regulation to protect sovereignty and social stability. This dual role—encouraging growth while restraining excess—remains central to the survival and legitimacy of the modern state.
