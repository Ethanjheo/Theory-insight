## Chapter Summary (Brief)
Over the past 25 years, democracy—guaranteeing human freedom and rights—has spread globally.  
While transnational corporations often act in self-serving ways, new social movements strongly support the expansion of democracy.  
If globalization is recognized not simply as a neoliberal ideology or elite strategy but as a broader social transformation, then democracy must be expanded toward a cosmopolitan model, supported by social movements that seek global justice.  

Globalization has become the most influential force shaping modern human life. As the roles of nation-states and the definition of citizenship shift, democratic institutions must undergo fundamental change. The political interpretation of globalization is crucial: it brings both opportunities for democracy and unprecedented risks.  

Most importantly, transnational financial capital centered on Wall Street exerts hegemony across the globe, threatening labor standards, environmental regulations, and democratic norms. Hence, globalization should not be rejected outright, but rather democratically regulated. Strengthening democracy at the global level requires both international cooperation and mechanisms to regulate corporations and financial capital.

## Rationale
The central rationale is that globalization represents both opportunity and risk. The challenge is to ensure democratic regulation so that globalization enhances freedom and equity rather than undermining them.

## Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries
- **Beneficiaries**: Transnational corporations, global financial capital, developed nations that benefit from liberalized markets.  
- **Non-Beneficiaries**: Developing countries with weak bargaining power, workers facing deteriorating conditions, citizens affected by environmental degradation.

## Content Summary (Perspective-Based Comparison)

### By Relevant Countries
- **United States**: Wall Street and transnational finance exercise disproportionate influence over global standards.  
- **Developing Countries**: Often pressured to lower environmental and labor standards to attract foreign capital.  
- **European Union**: More proactive in embedding democratic principles within globalization (e.g., social charters, human rights frameworks).  
- **South Korea**: Rapidly integrated into global markets, balancing export-led growth with democratic expansion.  
- **Australia**: Balances its resource-based economy with global trade, facing tensions between environmental standards and corporate influence.  

### By Academic Discipline
- **Sociology**: Examines globalization as a driver of new social movements and changing identities.  
- **Political Science**: Focuses on global governance, democracy, and the weakening of the nation-state.  
- **Economics**: Highlights both growth opportunities and inequalities reinforced by global capital flows.  
- **Environmental Studies**: Critiques globalization for exacerbating ecological degradation while advocating sustainable models.  

### Past vs. Present (Korea & Australia)
- **Korea (Past)**: Authoritarian modernization and export growth under strong state control.  
- **Korea (Present)**: Active democracy but vulnerable to global financial volatility.  
- **Australia (Past)**: Depended on natural resource exports within imperial trade systems.  
- **Australia (Present)**: Liberal democracy within global trade, facing debates over environmental policies and foreign corporate influence.  

### Security Convergence
- **Potential Problems**:  
  - Cyber manipulation of democratic processes by transnational actors.  
  - Regulatory capture by global corporations undermining national sovereignty.  
- **Solutions**:  
  - Strengthen global cyber governance frameworks.  
  - Establish binding international regulations on corporate transparency and accountability.

## Accuracy vs. Coherence
- **Accuracy**: Refers to measurable, data-driven evidence (e.g., IMF, ILO, or OECD statistics on labor and democracy).  
- **Coherence**: Refers to whether globalization and democracy logically align within theoretical frameworks. The concept of global democracy has strong coherence as an academic framework but lacks comprehensive empirical confirmation due to ongoing structural inequalities.

## Personal Reflection
Cosmopolitan democracy has been evolving for nearly three decades but remains an ongoing process rather than a consolidated system. While new models are proposed, it is still too early to definitively evaluate their effectiveness. Only when a stable global culture emerges can judgments be made with greater accuracy.  

In the meantime, the direction should be to preserve universal rights and orient globalization toward freedom and happiness. Transnational corporations should not be suppressed outright, but their growth should align with democratic expansion rather than pure expediency. This would ensure broader benefits across societies. Furthermore, elevating the global standing of developing nations and incorporating their voices is essential, rather than relying solely on the power dynamics of advanced economies.

## Literature-Based Evidence
The text does not cite specific datasets or scholarly references. However, the arguments align with critical globalization literature (e.g., Held on cosmopolitan democracy, UNDP reports on inequality). Future validation would require empirical data on labor conditions, environmental standards, and financial governance.
