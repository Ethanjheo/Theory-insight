## 1. Core Concepts (Cognitive Ease & Jumping to Conclusions)  
- **Cognitive Ease:**  
  - When information feels easy to process, we are more likely to believe it is true.  
  - Familiarity, repetition, and clarity all increase acceptance.  
  - Danger: comfort reduces critical thinking.  

- **Norms and Surprises:**  
  - People hold mental “norms” of what is expected.  
  - When something deviates, surprise occurs and we immediately search for causes.  

- **Jumping to Conclusions:**  
  - System 1 generates quick interpretations with little evidence.  
  - Useful for speed, but risky for accuracy.  

- **Key Point:** Our brains prefer comfort and stories, but this preference often leads us to premature or false judgments.

## 2. Real-World Applications  
- **Marketing:** Brands repeat slogans to exploit cognitive ease, making products feel more trustworthy.  
- **Finance:** Investors grow overconfident with familiar patterns, leading to bubbles or risky trades.  
- **Workplace:** Managers may misinterpret anomalies by forcing causal stories instead of analyzing data.  
- **Everyday Life:** We tend to trust repeated news headlines or rumors without checking sources.

## 3. Key Takeaways  
- **Ease feels like truth**: repetition and clarity bias our judgment.  
- **Surprise triggers stories**: humans are natural storytellers, but causal links may be false.  
- **System 1’s speed** is helpful but also responsible for stereotypes and overconfidence.  
- To avoid mistakes, we must slow down and apply System 2 when evidence is thin.

## My Reflection  
Kahneman argued that familiarity often deceives people into mistaking it for truth. This raises the possibility that what we call “truth” may, in fact, be shaped or even manipulated by our environment. Human beings form ideas within their surroundings, and these accumulated ideas create the flow of thought. If so, the environment itself may become the reference point by which people judge truth.

This reliance on perceptual experience increases the likelihood of cognitive dissonance. Thoughts constructed from personal experience can be either subjective or objective, but without reflection or comparison with external information, one cannot distinguish between the two. When such unexamined assumptions serve as the basis of reasoning, the entire chain of thought risks being flawed from the outset.

Thus, familiarity not only generates illusions of truth but can also weaken our capacity to perceive the world accurately. Yet familiarity has practical value: while it lowers accuracy in judgment, it often enhances efficiency and even emotional satisfaction.

In conclusion, it seems essential to train ourselves to distinguish when and how to employ System 1 and System 2, depending on context and purpose.
