## 1) Core Concepts (Heuristics & Biases)

### A. Law of Small Numbers
- **Idea:** People expect **small samples** to reflect the whole population.  
- **Result:** Overconfidence, false patterns, wrong conclusions.  

### B. Representativeness Heuristic
- **Idea:** Judging probability by resemblance to a stereotype rather than base rates.  
- **Example:** “Steve looks like a librarian” → people ignore how many **farmers** there actually are.  

### C. Availability Heuristic
- **Idea:** Likelihood is judged by **how easily examples come to mind**.  
- **Result:** Vivid stories or news dominate risk perception.  

### D. Anchoring
- **Idea:** First numbers strongly **pull later judgments**.  
- Even irrelevant or random anchors shift estimates.

## 2) Real-World Applications
- **Finance:** Short-term noise mistaken for long-term trends (law of small numbers). IPO hype acts as anchor.  
- **Medicine:** Doctors may overestimate effects from too few cases.  
- **Policy/Media:** Repeated headlines inflate public concern (availability).  
- **Business:** First offer in negotiation sets a powerful anchor.

## 3) Key Takeaways
- **Ease ≠ truth:** Patterns in small data often mislead.  
- **Representativeness trap:** Looks like X ≠ high probability of X.  
- **Availability bias:** Memorable ≠ frequent.  
- **Anchoring effect:** First number sticks even when irrelevant.

## 4) Anti-Bias Playbook
1. **Check sample size** before drawing conclusions.  
2. **Use base rates** instead of stereotypes.  
3. **Separate salience from frequency** when judging risk.  
4. **Reset anchors**: ask, “If I didn’t hear the first number, what would my estimate be?”

## 5) My Reflection
Our brain deceives us. Why is that? I hypothesize that one cause lies in the structure of modern industry, where intervals between changes have become increasingly compressed.

For most of history, we relied on intuition, as it was directly tied to survival. Yet with the development of technology and culture, institutional structures emerged to protect life. In this new context, the age has arrived in which we must look at the world not through intuition but through logic.

Technological progress demands logical reasoning, and within society, choices based on logic are increasingly regarded as superior to those based on intuition.

Still, I do not see System 1 as inferior to System 2. Their value depends on the situation. In moments that require rapid decisions, intuition is indispensable, whereas in contexts where time allows, logic enhances accuracy and reliability.

Therefore, the crucial step is to judge first what purpose we are pursuing. Once the purpose is clear, we should apply System 1 or System 2 accordingly. And when engaging System 2, we must remain cautious of the four main cognitive traps—anchoring, representativeness, availability, and familiarity—that distort our reasoning.
