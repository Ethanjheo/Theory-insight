## 1. Core Concepts (Two Systems)  
- **System 1 (Fast Thinking):**  
  - Operates automatically and quickly, with little effort or voluntary control.  
  - Examples: recognizing a face as angry, completing an easy word, knowing that 2+2=4.  

- **System 2 (Slow Thinking):**  
  - Allocates attention to effortful mental activities requiring concentration.  
  - Examples: solving 17×24, checking logic in an argument, filling out complex tax forms.  

- **Key Point:** System 1 is fast but prone to errors; System 2 is accurate but effortful and slow.

## 2. Real-World Applications  
- **Finance:** Quick intuition (System 1) may bias investors (“I like Ford cars, so Ford stock must be good”).  
- **Workplace:** Managers may rely on gut feeling but need System 2 for data-driven decisions.  
- **Everyday Life:** System 1 helps with survival by reacting instantly, but System 2 is needed for deliberate planning.

## 3. Key Takeaways  
- Our mental life can be explained as an interaction of **two agents**: System 1 (intuitive) and System 2 (deliberate).  
- System 1 is more influential than we realize and drives many of our choices.  
- The challenge: knowing **when to rely on intuition** vs. **when to engage deliberate reasoning**.

## My Reflection  
Understanding the two-system model changes how I interpret my own judgments.  
Often, what feels like a rational choice is actually a **System 1 shortcut**, not careful reasoning.  
For both cybersecurity strategy and daily decision-making, the real skill is to **recognize situations where System 1 might mislead** and to deliberately activate System 2.
