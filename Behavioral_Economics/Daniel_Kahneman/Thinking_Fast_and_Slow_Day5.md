## 1) Core Concepts (Integration & Applications)

### A. Predictable Irrationality
- **Idea:** Human judgment errors are **systematic rather than random**.  
- **Implication:** In similar contexts, people repeat the same mistakes → errors can be corrected through design.

### B. Framing & Defaults
- **Framing:** The same fact can lead to different choices depending on its **presentation**.  
- **Defaults:** Default options serve as powerful attractors due to the laziness of System 2.

### C. Nudge (Choice Architecture)
- **Idea:** Restructuring the **architecture of choice** guides people toward better outcomes while preserving freedom.  
- **Tools:** Defaults, framing (loss/gain), simplification, timing.

### D. Bias Checklist (System 2 Trigger)
- Before major decisions, check for **representativeness, availability, anchoring, and framing** to interrupt automation.

## 2) Real-World Applications
- **Policy:** Automatic enrollment in pension plans significantly increases participation rates.  
- **Healthcare:** “90% survival rate” vs “10% mortality rate” → framing shifts treatment choices.  
- **Business/Marketing:** **$9.99** pricing and first-offer anchoring influence decisions.  
- **Personal Finance:** Defaults such as auto-transfer and rebalancing reduce procrastination.

## 3) Key Takeaways
- **Biases are predictable** → they can be mitigated by design.  
- **Framing and defaults** strongly shape outcomes.  
- **System 2 is lazy** → checklists are required to force its activation.  
- Sound judgment depends not only on facts but also on **how those facts are presented**.

## 4) Anti-Bias Playbook
1. **Check base rates** before intuition.  
2. **Remove anchors:** Ask, “What would my estimate be without the first number?”  
3. **Flip the frame:** Test if conclusions hold under loss vs. gain wording.  
4. **Audit defaults:** Am I choosing this simply because it’s the preset option?  
5. **Decision log:** Record probabilities and reasoning to prevent hindsight bias.

## 5) My Reflection
Prejudice exerts a formidable influence on human cognition. Our judgments often rely heavily on perceptual experience, which leads us to neglect higher-level objective information such as base rates.

Why, then, do we tend to treat frequent exposure as truth? Even when frequency does not equate to probability, repeated exposure manipulates our cognition. This underscores the significance of the environment: if people internalize whatever they are exposed to as “truth,” then consistent policies and restrictions on subliminal advertising (e.g., Coca-Cola cases) become essential for safeguarding rational decision-making.

When we begin with the premise that humans are fundamentally irrational, it paradoxically enables us to monitor and restrain subjective biases more effectively. This perspective aligns closely with Daniel Kahneman’s foundational insights in behavioral economics.

In societies that prioritize utility or immediate satisfaction, the intuitive judgments of System 1 may appear efficient. Yet, when accuracy and probability of correctness matter, System 2’s deliberate reasoning becomes indispensable. Ultimately, wisdom lies in discerning the proper context for engaging each system, rather than privileging one absolutely over the other.
