## Day 2: Habitus and the Social Conditioning of Taste  

### 1. Core Concept
- **Habitus**: a system of durable dispositions shaped by one’s upbringing, education, and social environment.  
- Habitus guides how people perceive the world, make judgments, and develop preferences.  
- Taste, therefore, is not a “free choice” but an expression of socially structured dispositions.

### 2. Taste as Structured by Social Position
- Upper classes cultivate “legitimate” tastes that require cultural training (e.g., classical music, philosophy).  
- Middle classes adopt aspirational tastes, imitating elite choices but often in diluted form.  
- Working classes prioritize necessity and practicality in their preferences.  
- These differences are not random but reflect **objective class positions**.

### 3. Mechanism of Reproduction
- **Cultural Capital Transmission**: Families pass on linguistic style, manners, and familiarity with elite culture.  
- **Educational System**: Rewards those already aligned with dominant tastes, reinforcing privilege.  
- **Symbolic Violence**: Elite tastes are imposed as universal standards, making alternative tastes appear inferior.

### 4. Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries
**Beneficiaries**  
- Children raised in environments rich in cultural and symbolic capital.  
- They internalize elite dispositions as “natural,” gaining advantages in school and society.  

**Non-Beneficiaries**  
- Those without exposure to refined cultural practices.  
- Their tastes are stigmatized as lacking refinement, reinforcing exclusion from privileged circles.  

---

### 5. Critical Implications
- **Taste is a product of habitus**: individual preference is socially conditioned, not freely chosen.  
- **Social reproduction**: Distinctions in taste perpetuate existing hierarchies.  
- **Misrecognition**: Society interprets elite tastes as “merit,” masking structural privilege.  
- **Modern relevance**: Fashion, fine dining, elite hobbies (e.g., golf, wine) remain symbolic markers of class distinction.

### 6. My reflection
We often speak of “equality of opportunity” in a legal sense, but in reality, life choices are already structured by accumulated forms of capital—economic, cultural, and social. Thus, individual decisions do not resemble a “roulette,” but rather display a path-dependent character. Choices are not simply the product of conscious calculation; they are automatically shaped by the interaction between acquired dispositions (habitus) and the surrounding environment. Although it is difficult to specify an exact proportion, extensive experimental evidence confirms that a large share of human judgment arises from fast and automatic processes (so-called System 1 thinking).

At this point, symbolic violence comes into play. The language, manners, and tastes of the upper classes are presented as “universal standards,” while the practices of other groups are stigmatized as “unrefined.” Everyday customs—such as table manners, leisure activities, or modes of speech—become subtle yet powerful instruments for making class visible and justifying exclusion.

As the Eastern proverb of Mencius’ “Three Moves of the Mother” (Mengmu sanqian) suggests, environmental choice has a profound impact on a child’s dispositions and achievements. Contemporary sociology reaches similar conclusions. Studies on the transmission of cultural and linguistic resources from families to schools show that family background systematically shapes educational outcomes and life trajectories. In South Korea, the linkage between strong school districts and rising housing prices illustrates how cultural capital is converted into educational capital, and eventually into economic capital.

From a policy perspective, applying the same rules to everyone—formal equality—is insufficient to stop social reproduction. Instead, interventions based on equity are necessary: reducing learning gaps, expanding cultural access, and strengthening early linguistic environments. Yet even with such reforms, the inter-conversion of capitals and the inertia of habitus mean that the pressures of reproduction do not easily disappear, a sobering reminder of structural persistence.
