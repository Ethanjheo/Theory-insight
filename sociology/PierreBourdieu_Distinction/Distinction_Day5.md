## Day 5: Symbolic Power and Social Reproduction  

### 1. Core Concept
- **Taste as Symbolic Power**:  
  - What appears as personal preference is in fact a mechanism of **class domination**.  
  - Dominant groups impose their tastes as the **legitimate standard**, delegitimizing alternatives as vulgar.  
- **Symbolic Violence**: Inequalities are reproduced invisibly, disguised as “natural differences” in culture.

### 2. Structured Differences
- **Dominant-Class Taste**  
  - Claims universality (e.g., “refined,” “cultured”).  
  - Functions as an instrument of exclusion by making other tastes appear inferior.  

- **Subordinate-Class Taste**  
  - Internalizes this hierarchy, often perceiving their own practices as “lesser.”  
  - This leads to self-censorship and acceptance of structural inequality.

### 3. Mechanism of Reproduction
- **Habitus**: Socially conditioned dispositions frame what feels natural or appropriate.  
- **Education System**: Rewards those already aligned with dominant tastes, legitimizing privilege as “merit.”  
- **Capital Circulation**: Economic, cultural, and social capital reinforce one another, ensuring that privilege persists across generations.

### 4. Critical Implications
- Cultural practices are not neutral; they are **political instruments of domination**.  
- Inequality persists not only through income gaps but also through **cultural reproduction** in daily life.  
- Even in modern consumer society, luxury brands, linguistic codes, and lifestyles still function as **class markers**.

### My Reflection
Taste cannot always be understood as a matter of personal inclination. From a structural perspective, ideas are shaped within a given environment. These ideas organize the flow of thought and eventually produce specific social outcomes. In other words, much of what we perceive as “natural disposition” is in fact unconsciously conditioned by external circumstances.

Thus, our ways of thinking cannot be separated from the environments in which we live. Kurt Lewin emphasized the primacy of environment over individual traits, and in the twentieth century, the academic consensus largely recognized that environment plays a decisive role in shaping individuals.

Pierre Bourdieu developed this argument further. He showed that taste is not a matter of free choice but a disposition formed by environment and then reproduced socially, thereby reinforcing the separation between dominant and subordinate classes.

In contemporary society, taste functions as a form of symbolic capital. Fine art is regarded as intellectual and refined, while popular culture (pop music, television dramas, films) is often dismissed as mere entertainment. This distinction legitimizes certain tastes as “high” while devaluing others, thereby creating in-groups and out-groups. As a result, the capacity to accumulate capital differs depending on one’s cultural orientation.

In conclusion, taste should not be reduced to an inner preference but rather understood as a structurally conditioned expression of class. However, such hierarchies of taste are not immutable. With shifting historical contexts and cultural currents, what once carried prestige can lose it, while new forms of taste may emerge as socially legitimized markers of distinction.
