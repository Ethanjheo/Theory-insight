## Day 3: Lifestyles and the Social Mapping of Taste

### 1. Core Concept
- Taste is inseparable from **lifestyle**, which includes food, clothing, housing, leisure, and speech.  
- Lifestyles form a **social map**: each class expresses its position through coherent patterns of consumption and behavior.  
- What seems like “personal style” is actually **structured by social position**.

### 2. Lifestyle as Class Expression
- **Upper Classes (Legitimate Taste)**  
  - Favor refinement, minimalism, and “art for art’s sake.”  
  - Example: wine tasting, art collecting, architectural design.  
- **Middle Classes (Pretentious or Aspirational Taste)**  
  - Attempt to imitate elite choices but often reveal “incomplete mastery.”  
  - Example: buying reproductions of famous paintings, gourmet-style dining at affordable chains.  
- **Working Classes (Taste of Necessity)**  
  - Practical, functional, quantity over quality.  
  - Example: hearty meals, mass-market furniture, television as leisure.

### 3. Mechanism of Distinction
- **Habitus shapes consumption**:  
  - What one eats, wears, or enjoys is not just preference but a marker of class location.  
- **Symbolic Boundaries**:  
  - Each class defines itself not only by what it consumes, but also by **distancing** itself from what others consume.  
- **Misrecognition**:  
  - Lifestyles appear to be “free choices” but are structurally conditioned.

### 4. Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries
**Beneficiaries**  
- Those born into environments where legitimate culture is normalized.  
- Can display lifestyle practices as “natural” and receive social validation.  

**Non-Beneficiaries**  
- Adopt practical or mass-market lifestyles due to constraints.  
- Their consumption patterns are stigmatized as lacking refinement, reinforcing exclusion.  

---

### 5. Critical Implications
- **Lifestyle is political**: it encodes and reproduces inequality.  
- **Everyday practices** (food, dress, speech, leisure) are arenas of class struggle.  
- **Modern relevance**: branded coffee shops, organic food culture, luxury fashion, and boutique fitness all function as signals of distinction.

### 6. My reflection
Lifestyle is a marker of class, but it is also profoundly shaped by cultural context. According to Geert Hofstede (1980, 2001) and his theory of cultural dimensions, in collectivist societies individual preferences are closely tied to social activities. For example, in East Asian contexts, hobbies that emphasize cooperation and group participation are generally preferred. In contrast, in Western societies with stronger individualist orientations, leisure activities that can be enjoyed alone are far more common.

Thus, lifestyle should not be understood merely as a framework for class division but must also be interpreted in relation to the cultural background of each society. In South Korea, for instance, luxury consumption functions as a marker of one’s class position, whereas in Western societies, language has historically played a more decisive role in class differentiation. Harvey J. Graff (1987), in The Legacies of Literacy, argues that literacy has never been a neutral skill but rather a tool for social exclusion and the reproduction of power. A striking example is found in pre-revolutionary France, where commoners were institutionally prevented from writing, thereby reinforcing class domination through information asymmetry. This illustrates how language and literacy functioned as key instruments in legitimizing class order in Western societies.

In conclusion, lifestyle is not simply about class distinctions expressed through hobbies or consumption. Instead, it should be viewed as a socially constructed device shaped by historical and cultural conditions. Hofstede’s emphasis on cultural value systems and Graff’s demonstration of the class-bound character of literacy together highlight that lifestyle is not a matter of free individual choice but rather a structural mechanism that reinforces social divisions.
