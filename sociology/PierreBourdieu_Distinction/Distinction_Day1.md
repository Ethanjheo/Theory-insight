## Day 1: Taste as Social Hierarchy

### 1. Core Concept
- **Taste is not neutral**: it operates as a mechanism of **social classification**.  
- Bourdieu: *“Taste classifies, and it classifies the classifier.”*  
  - Taste is not merely individual preference; it categorizes people and simultaneously reveals their social position.

### 2. Cultural Hierarchies
- **Legitimate Culture (Upper-Class Taste)**  
  - Classical music, fine arts, philosophy, haute cuisine.  
  - Requires high levels of cultural capital to access and appreciate.  
- **Middle-Class Culture**  
  - Attempts to emulate legitimate culture, but often partial or “incomplete.”  
  - Example: preference for simplified classics or popularized versions of opera.  
- **Popular Culture (Working-Class Taste)**  
  - Oriented toward necessity: quantity, price, practical utility.  
  - Example: simple meals, popular music, mass entertainment.

### 3. Mechanism of Social Distinction
- Cultural capital (education, upbringing) determines **what people like**.  
- Taste functions as a tool for **legitimizing inequality**:
  - Upper classes present their taste as “refined” and “natural.”  
  - Working-class preferences are stigmatized as “vulgar” or “unsophisticated.”

### 4. Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries
**Beneficiaries**  
- Families with strong cultural and educational backgrounds.  
- Children exposed to books, art, and refined practices from an early age.  
- Can frame their tastes as *merit*, disguising inherited privilege.  

**Non-Beneficiaries**  
- Individuals lacking access to elite cultural resources.  
- Their preferences are often dismissed as inferior.  
- Struggle against an invisible hierarchy of legitimacy.  

---

### 5. Critical Implications
- **Taste is political**: it sustains class divisions while appearing “natural.”  
- **Misrecognition**: people think taste is personal, but it is structurally conditioned.  
- **Modern relevance**: luxury brands, gourmet food, and elite education still function as tools of distinction today.

## Personal Reflection
Pierre Bourdieu’s The Forms of Capital (1986) can be closely connected to the notion of path dependence.

Human choices are not simply guided by the normative ideal of “equal opportunity,” but are instead constrained within the structured range of options produced by accumulated capital. In other words, individual actions are determined through interactions with an already established social environment. This aligns with Kurt Lewin’s field theory, expressed in the formula F = f(P × E) (behavior is a function of the person and the environment). Contemporary psychology likewise affirms that environmental factors exert a profound influence on choice.

This perspective suggests that societies begin from a structurally stratified position shaped by environment. Such structural divisions can also be observed in economic and educational contexts. A representative case is found in South Korea, where regions with higher academic achievement (e.g., Gangnam, Mok-dong, Bundang, Suji) attract greater demand, which in turn drives up housing prices.

In conclusion, path dependence should not be interpreted solely as a language of “despair.” Rather, it serves as an analytical insight: by conceptualizing social structures, redirecting the flow of thought, and consciously reshaping one’s environment, it becomes possible to carve out new trajectories of life.
