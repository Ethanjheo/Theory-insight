## Chapter Summary (Brief)
The development of information technology has accelerated administrative processing and enabled new forms of education such as remote learning. However, these advances also created side effects, including computer crime, personal data breaches, information pollution, security risks, technical errors, cultural lag, and employment problems.  

Information technology has also reshaped social life. As the information society expands, new forms of online communities are emerging. Unlike traditional families or workplaces, cyber communities emphasize horizontal networks and voluntary participation rather than hierarchy and coercion.  

The rise of the information society inevitably influences politics. Internet-based voting and online surveys broaden the scope of direct political participation. As a result, electronic democracy in the 21st century may become a foundation for participatory democracy.  

Finally, the information society has strengthened the role of civil society. A sustainable society should not be a jungle of endless competition but a system where individuals understand and support each other.

## Social Justification
The information society emphasizes inclusivity and participatory democracy, aiming to create a civil society where cooperation replaces cutthroat competition.

## Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries
- **Beneficiaries:** Digitally literate groups, technologically advanced countries, and individuals with higher education who can leverage IT for political, economic, and social opportunities.  
- **Non-Beneficiaries:** Technologically marginalized populations, underprivileged groups, and those exposed to digital crime or unable to adapt to rapid technological change.  

## Mainstream Interpretation (Coherence)
Mainstream perspectives interpret the information society as both progress and disruption. While it expands civic participation and efficiency, it also magnifies inequality, cultural lag, and new forms of social conflict. The coherent consensus is that proper governance and education are critical to mitigating risks.

## Divergent Interpretations
- **By Relevant Countries:**  
  - **South Korea:** Focuses on integrating IT into education, governance, and expanding e-democracy.  
  - **United States:** Highlights online communities, cybersecurity, and implications for participatory democracy.  
  - **Developing Countries:** Frame the information society as a challenge, often seeing digital inequality as an extension of global structural dependency.  

- **By Academic Discipline:**  
  - **Sociology:** Analyzes online communities, stratification, and cultural transformation.  
  - **Political Science:** Examines e-democracy, participatory politics, and state-society relations.  
  - **Economics:** Studies labor displacement, digital markets, and economic inequalities from IT shifts.  

- **Security Perspective (Convergence with Cybersecurity):**  
  Information growth increases exposure to cybercrime, privacy risks, and digital inequality. Solutions include digital literacy programs, strong cybersecurity measures, and governance structures to ensure equitable access.

## Personal Reflection
The advancement of information has triggered profound transformations in modern civilization. Yet, such progress has not been universally beneficial. For some, it created opportunities for faster decision-making and logical reasoning, while for others, it introduced digital exclusion and vulnerability to cybercrime.  

History shows that societal progress never benefits everyone equally. Thus, individuals must adapt to the demands of the current era by cultivating the necessary skills and awareness to navigate the opportunities and risks of the information society.
