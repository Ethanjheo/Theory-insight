## Personal Reflection  
To understand institutions, one must begin with an understanding of national culture.  
For instance, Korean society is rooted in collectivism and hierarchical structures, whereas Australian society tends toward individualism and flat, horizontal organization.  
Abstract cultural concepts must be contextualized and applied to real societal dynamics.  
As anthropologist Edward T. Hall distinguished between high-context and low-context cultures, we too must adopt a deductive and probabilistic way of thinking that reflects these cultural logics.
