##  Personal Insight

To understand the flow of capital, we must first understand how society moves.  
Money does not flow freely outside institutions—true wealth operates within systems.  
Without legitimacy, outsiders face resistance and limitations.  
Therefore, understanding the relationships between class, the state, individuals, and business is not optional—it is strategic.  
Mastering these structures is the foundation of true influence and capital accumulation.

## 1. Historical Materialism

- Society is shaped by its mode of production—how people make a living (e.g., farming, industry, digital economy).
- Economic structures (like tools, land, and technology) determine class relations.
- Culture, laws, and institutions are built on the economic base.

**"The economy determines the shape of society."**

## 2. Political Science (Power & Class)

- Politics is not neutral; the state often represents the interests of dominant classes.
- Ideology is the tool used by the ruling class to justify its dominance.
- Class conflict is inherent—between those who control production and those who do not.

**"Politics is about who controls what, and for whom the rules are written."**
