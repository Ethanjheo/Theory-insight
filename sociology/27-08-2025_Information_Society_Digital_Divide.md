## Chapter Summary (Brief)
Futurists often described the advent of the information society with optimism. Alvin Toffler highlighted the integration of science and technology, focusing on automation in both production and office work. However, alongside these advancements, new forms of inequality emerged, particularly the digital divide.

According to a 2000 U.S. Department of Commerce report, households with annual incomes above $75,000 used the internet 20 times more and computers 9 times more than low-income groups. Similarly, a 2007 survey by the Korea Agency for Digital Opportunity and Promotion showed that households with monthly incomes above 4 million KRW had information access levels 19.3% higher than average, and 27% higher than recipients of basic livelihood support.

## Social Justification
The digital divide is not only a technical issue but also a pressing social challenge. Access to information determines social inclusion, economic mobility, and civic participation. Bridging this divide is necessary for social justice and long-term stability.

## Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries
- **Beneficiaries:** High-income groups, educated populations, and technologically advanced nations benefit from greater access to digital tools and resources.
- **Non-Beneficiaries:** Low-income groups, less-educated populations, and developing countries remain marginalized, reinforcing existing socio-economic inequalities.

## Mainstream Interpretation (Coherence)
Mainstream sociology views the digital divide as an extension of existing inequalities in class and education. The consensus is that unless addressed, digital inequality amplifies traditional forms of social stratification. Thus, the information society does not eliminate inequality but transforms its expression.

## Divergent Interpretations
- **By Relevant Countries:**  
  - **United States:** Focuses on the economic consequences of digital exclusion, linking it to productivity and competitiveness.  
  - **South Korea:** Emphasizes educational and social policy, with public programs to improve access among disadvantaged groups.  
  - **Developing Countries:** Frame digital inequality as a structural problem tied to global power imbalances and technological dependency.

- **By Academic Discipline:**  
  - **Sociology:** Highlights inequality, stratification, and social exclusion.  
  - **Economics:** Focuses on productivity gaps and labor market disadvantages.  
  - **Political Science:** Examines implications for democracy and civic participation.  

- **Security Perspective (Convergence with Cybersecurity):**  
  Digital inequality creates vulnerabilities where marginalized groups become more susceptible to misinformation, fraud, and cyber exploitation. Bridging the divide requires not only access but also cybersecurity education and safeguards.

## Personal Reflection
The expansion of digital information has paradoxically diminished the significance of individual presence in society. While information sharing promotes diverse perspectives, the dark side lies in structural exclusion. In the early 2000s, only 16% of the global population in developed countries controlled 90% of computers, creating a path-dependent barrier for late adopters. Today, this legacy persists, with digital infrastructure tailored to the advantage of advanced nations.

Information society also deepens class differentiation. Educational attainment determines the quality of digital engagement, reinforcing economic inequality. Furthermore, the abundance of information undermines coherence; only actors with access to reliable, structured information benefit, while others face confusion and exclusion.

Ultimately, the digital divide reproduces traditional inequalities of income and education. Addressing this requires proactive investment in public digital education and inclusive information policies, ensuring that disadvantaged groups are not left behind in the global knowledge economy.
