## Chapter 1: General Concept of Capital

### 1. Definition of Capital
- Capital is **accumulated labor** (in materialized or embodied form).  
- When actors or groups appropriate it exclusively, they gain control over social energy.  
- Capital functions as both **vis insita** (an immanent force within structures) and **lex insita** (the law inscribed in social relations).  

### 2. Characteristics of Capital
- It requires **time to accumulate** and can reproduce itself in an expanded form.  
- Unlike pure chance, capital introduces **persistence, inertia, and inheritance** into social life.  
- Social positions are not equal starting points; capital ensures **continuity and inequality**.  

### 3. Conversion of Capitals
- Different types of capital (economic, cultural, social, symbolic) can be transformed into one another.  
- Example: Economic capital (money) can buy education (cultural capital), which later brings prestige (symbolic capital).  

### 4. Capital and Social Structure
- The distribution of different forms of capital structures the **social field**.  
- This structure determines opportunities, constraints, and the likelihood of success for individuals and groups.  

### 5. Beyond Pure Chance
- Society is not like a roulette wheel where every spin offers equal opportunity.  
- Accumulated capital makes outcomes **path-dependent**: past accumulation shapes present and future chances.

## 6. Social Justification
- Unequal accumulation of capital often faces **social resistance** if explained purely as self-interest.  
- Therefore, elites frame their accumulation with **public-oriented justifications**:
  - Education capital = "Human resource development"  
  - Symbolic capital = "National prestige"  
  - Economic capital = "Economic growth for all"

## 7. Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries
- **Beneficiaries:**  
  - Those already possessing economic, cultural, or symbolic capital.  
  - Can reproduce and expand their advantages.  

- **Non-Beneficiaries:**  
  - Those lacking access to capital.  
  - Face barriers in education, social mobility, and recognition.

## 8. Personal Reflection
Although Bourdieu’s analysis is objective and intellectually rigorous, presenting it merely as a factual account risks provoking social resistance. Thus, I believe it is essential to reinterpret his arguments through the language of social justification.

Bourdieu emphasizes path dependence, the role of family in capital accumulation, and the idea that society operates not by chance but by the force of accumulated capital. Yet such explanations may also deepen class conflicts.

What I find particularly compelling is Bourdieu’s ability to conceptualize abstract social rules and analyze them with logical precision. He shows how accumulated capital attracts additional forms of capital: economic capital generates cultural and social capital, which in turn reproduce and expand economic capital. Through this process, authority and prestige are accumulated and eventually become new sources of capital.

Ultimately, society functions within a pre-structured hierarchy, making it difficult to overcome such barriers through individual effort alone. Yet understanding these dynamics and acting within them are two separate matters. The crucial task is to confront the structural realities of society with clarity while maintaining the determination to transform them. For me, it is precisely in this tension—between recognition of constraints and the pursuit of change—that human dignity and beauty emerge. 

### Rather than a theory of despair, it is better understood as an anatomical tool for social reform
