## Personal Reflection
Modern social structures are intertwined with diverse and often conflicting interests, making it difficult to interpret the world through a single universal truth. Expanding our perspectives is crucial to grasp this complexity.  

The Internet and automation undeniably threaten certain jobs, but this does not imply the complete disappearance of employment. Rather, new forms of work are emerging, requiring adaptation and continuous skill development.
