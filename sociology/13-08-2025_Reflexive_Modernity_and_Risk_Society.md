## Chapter Summary (Brief)
This section examines the transition from the Cold War era to the modern global order, highlighting the victory of liberal capitalism and American-style democracy, while noting that such dominance is neither permanent nor immune to challenges. The narrative moves into Ulrich Beck's "Risk Society" and Anthony Giddens' concept of "Reflexive Modernity," focusing on manufactured risks such as environmental pollution, nuclear proliferation, and climate crises. It emphasizes the need for societies to continually reassess and reform policies and systems in response to these risks.

## Content Summary (Perspective-Based Comparison)

### By Relevant Countries
- **United States**: Maintained global leadership post-Cold War through NATO alliances, economic influence, and promotion of liberal democracy, but faces criticism for structural inequalities and geopolitical risks.
- **Soviet Union/Russia**: Transitioned from Cold War superpower rivalry to regional influence, challenging Western dominance in certain arenas.
- **Non-Western Societies (e.g., China, Islamic countries)**: Emerging challenges to Western-led order, often resisting imposed reforms without tangible national benefits.

### By Academic Discipline
- **Political Science**: Shift from ideological confrontation (Cold War) to soft power competition and geopolitical risk management.
- **Economics**: Persistence of global inequality despite economic liberalization.
- **Sociology**: Emphasis on reflexive modernity, risk society, and the weakening of tradition.
- **Environmental Studies**: Recognition of manufactured risks as core issues in advanced societies.

### Past vs. Present (Korea and Australia)
- **Korea (Past)**: Post-war industrialization with strong state-led development; Cold War alignment with the US.
- **Korea (Present)**: Advanced economy but increasingly exposed to global risks such as climate change and geopolitical tensions.
- **Australia (Past)**: Peripheral role in Cold War, aligned with Western bloc through ANZUS and economic ties.
- **Australia (Present)**: Stable democracy but vulnerable to environmental risks (e.g., bushfires, climate change) and economic dependence on global trade networks.

### Security Convergence (Potential Problems + Solutions)
- **Potential Problems**:
  - Cyber vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure amplifying manufactured risks.
  - Disinformation undermining public trust in policy reforms.
  - Resistance from states unwilling to reform without direct benefits.
- **Solutions**:
  - Integrating risk management into national cybersecurity strategies.
  - Building international coalitions based on mutual economic and security benefits.
  - Continuous policy review supported by transparent data sharing.

## Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries
- **Beneficiaries**: Countries with adaptive governance, strong alliances, and capacity to manage manufactured risks through policy innovation.
- **Non-Beneficiaries**: States with rigid political systems, limited resources, and heavy reliance on vulnerable industries.

## Personal Reflection
Modern society, through continuous development, has improved living standards, yet persistent issues have emerged in the process. Anthony Giddens defines this as "high modernity," where manufactured risks such as environmental degradation, nuclear proliferation, and climate crises intensify. Addressing these requires reflexive modernityâ€”an ongoing process of recognizing problems and revising policies and institutions. However, limitations remain: it is unrealistic to demand structural changes from stakeholder nations based solely on moral grounds. Practical reforms require alignment between normative goals and the tangible interests of the states involved.
