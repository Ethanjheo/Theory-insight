## Summary

- Marx sees society as built on a **material base**: productive forces + relations of production.
- **Superstructures** (law, politics, religion) reflect and support this base.
- **Ideology** masks class interests and stabilizes power.
- **Alienation** occurs when people are estranged from their labor and from themselves.
- Compared South Korea’s capitalist hierarchy with Australia's welfare-influenced structure.

## Personal Reflection

> Security isn’t just technical.

Social engineering, human error, and systemic control show that **security is deeply social**.  
To understand and defend systems effectively, one must study **ideology, structure, and human behavior**—not just code.
