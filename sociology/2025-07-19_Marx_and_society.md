## Personal Reflection

Is Marx truly a villain?

In Korea, socialism is often heavily criticized and labeled as “evil.” But who defines this evil—and for whose benefit?

Moral judgments shift depending on the ideology of the ruling group. Nordic countries redistribute wealth to support the working class. To the rich, it’s unfair; to the common people, it’s salvation.

South Korea did not adopt social democracy. Instead, capitalism permeates society—politically, economically, and culturally. This benefits the privileged class, sometimes at the expense of the working majority. The visible order may serve hidden control.

Yet from a political science lens, the problem looks different again.

That’s why we must broaden our intellectual perspective. Social phenomena change based on the viewpoint—be it structural, historical, or subjective.
