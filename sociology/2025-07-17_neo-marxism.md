## Overview

This entry summarizes and reflects on key Marxist concepts introduced in the sociology textbook *An Introduction to Sociology for the New Generation* by Kim Yoon-tae (김윤태). The chapter on Karl Marx introduces three main ideas:

1. **The Communist Manifesto**  
2. **The Proletariat**  
3. **Neo-Marxism**

These concepts, though rooted in the 19th and 20th centuries, still have analytical value in understanding inequality and power structures today.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Communist Manifesto  
Originally written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848, this manifesto called on workers ("the proletariat") to unite against capitalist exploitation. It claimed that history is a series of class struggles and predicted that capitalism would eventually be replaced by a classless society.

### 2. The Proletariat  
The proletariat refers to the working class—those who do not own the means of production and must sell their labor. In modern societies, this includes wage workers in both blue-collar and white-collar settings. The concept is still relevant when analyzing labor exploitation, income inequality, and the rise of union movements.

### 3. Neo-Marxism  
Neo-Marxism extends classical Marxist ideas into new domains—such as culture, ideology, education, and media. Thinkers like Antonio Gramsci emphasized the role of "cultural hegemony" where the ruling class maintains control not just economically but ideologically, shaping values and beliefs to sustain their dominance.

## Modern Implications

- **Labor Unions**: Today’s labor unions can be seen as modern expressions of proletarian resistance against capitalist power, echoing Marx's concerns about worker exploitation.
- **Inequality Analysis**: Neo-Marxism provides tools to critique how institutions (e.g., schools, media) normalize inequality.
- **Corporate & State Power**: The concentration of economic and political power in a few hands can be interpreted through a neo-Marxist lens as a modern form of class dominance.

## Personal Reflection

Studying Marx and Neo-Marxism is not about endorsing communism. It’s about gaining tools to critically analyze how economic structures, labor dynamics, and cultural narratives shape power in society. As a cybersecurity strategist in training, understanding these structures helps me better see how digital control systems and cyber policies also reflect broader power dynamics.
