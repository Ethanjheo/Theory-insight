## 3. Perspective-Based Comparison

### a. By Relevant Countries

- **France**: The French Revolution dismantled feudal aristocracy, introduced republican ideals, and influenced democratic movements worldwide.
- **Russia**: The 1917 revolution established a socialist state, which later collapsed, transitioning to a market-oriented democracy.
- **China**: The Chinese Revolution, led by the Communist Party, reshaped rural society and centralized political power.
- **South Korea**: Experienced political uprisings such as the April 19 Revolution and June Democratic Uprising, transitioning from authoritarianism to democracy.

### b. By Academic Discipline

- **Political Science**: Focuses on the transition of power, regime change, and governance structures post-revolution.
- **Sociology**: Studies class conflict, cultural hegemony shifts, and the role of civil society in sustaining change.
- **History**: Documents the causes, processes, and consequences of revolutions in different regions and eras.

### c. Historical Comparison: Korea vs. Australia

| Aspect                  | Korea (Past → Present)                                                 | Australia (Past → Present)                                           |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Form of Political Change| Violent uprisings (e.g., coups, mass protests) → Institutional democratization | Gradual reform within parliamentary democracy → Policy-driven social change |
| Role of Civil Society   | Mobilized in large-scale street movements → Organized advocacy and NGOs | Continuous engagement via interest groups and community activism      |
| Revolution Approach     | Regime overthrow and constitutional reforms                            | Policy and legislative reforms without systemic collapse              |

### d. Security Integration Perspective

- **Potential Issue**: Political revolutions or regime changes can weaken institutional stability, leading to vulnerabilities in national security and critical infrastructure protection.
- **Suggested Solutions**:
  - Embed cybersecurity governance within transitional political frameworks
  - International cooperation to secure critical systems during political instability
  - Maintain independent regulatory bodies to safeguard essential services regardless of regime changes

## 4. Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries

- **Beneficiaries**:
  - Marginalized groups gaining political rights after regime change
  - Reform-oriented political parties
  - Civil society organizations advocating systemic reform

- **Non-Beneficiaries**:
  - Elites losing political or economic dominance
  - Industries dependent on old regimes
  - Populations affected by instability during transitional periods

## 5. Personal Reflection

Revolutions are catalysts for deep societal transformation, but their outcomes vary depending on structural conditions, leadership, and public participation. Historical examples show that while some revolutions deliver lasting democratic gains, others replace one form of oppression with another. In the modern context, systemic change is increasingly pursued through institutional channels, negotiated reforms, and civil society engagement, rather than through violent upheavals. This evolution suggests that governance, stability, and inclusive participation are critical for ensuring that revolutionary change leads to sustainable and equitable societies.
