## Book Notes (Content-Focused Summary)

### Core Argument: The Moral Limits of Meritocracy
Sandel argues that modern meritocratic societies produce not only inequality, but also moral and social harm.  
Meritocracy claims that success is the result of individual talent and effort, but this belief obscures the role of luck, social background, and structural advantage.

As a result, success is often interpreted as moral deservingness, while failure is seen as personal fault.

### Social Consequences of Meritocracy
Meritocracy generates three key social outcomes:
- **Elite hubris**: those who succeed believe they deserve their status
- **Humiliation of losers**: those who fail internalize blame
- **Social fragmentation**: erosion of shared civic solidarity

This dynamic deepens resentment and weakens the sense of a common good.

### Conditions Behind “Merit”
Sandel emphasizes that what counts as merit depends on factors largely beyond individual control:
- innate talent
- family background and upbringing
- social recognition of certain skills
- luck and timing

Because these conditions are unequally distributed, meritocratic outcomes cannot be fully justified as fair.

### Education, Work, and Inequality
In education, competitive testing appears fair but often reinforces class advantage through unequal access to resources.  
In the labor market, wages come to reflect market value rather than human dignity, linking income to perceived worth.

These mechanisms contribute to the reproduction of social hierarchy.

### Critique of Meritocratic Justice
Sandel challenges the moral claim that market outcomes reflect desert.  
He argues that meritocracy fails to acknowledge how deeply success depends on social cooperation and collective institutions.

### Toward the Common Good
Rather than offering a technical policy blueprint, Sandel calls for:
- greater humility among the successful
- recognition of shared dependence
- renewed focus on the dignity of all forms of work

The book ultimately reframes inequality as a moral and civic problem, not only an economic one.
