## 1. Core Definition

### Deep Work
Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that:
- Push cognitive capabilities to their limit
- Create new value
- Improve skill
- Are difficult to replicate

### Shallow Work
Non-cognitively demanding tasks that:
- Are logistical or reactive
- Are easily replicable
- Often performed while distracted

---

## 2. Deep Work Hypothesis

The ability to perform deep work is:

- Increasingly rare  
- Increasingly valuable  
- A key competitive advantage in the knowledge economy  

---

## 3. Why Deep Work Matters

Success depends on two abilities:

1. The ability to quickly learn hard things  
2. The ability to produce at an elite level  

Both require sustained, high-intensity focus.

---

## 4. Productivity Formula

High-Quality Work Produced  
= Time Spent × Intensity of Focus  

Focus intensity is more important than duration alone.

---

## 5. Four Philosophies of Deep Work

### 1. Monastic
- Eliminate shallow obligations
- Extreme isolation

### 2. Bimodal
- Divide time between deep focus periods and normal activity

### 3. Rhythmic
- Schedule deep work at the same time every day

### 4. Journalistic
- Enter deep work whenever opportunity appears

---

## 6. Embrace Boredom

- Deep work requires the ability to tolerate boredom
- Avoid constant digital stimulation
- Train attention instead of reacting to distractions

---

## 7. Minimize Social Media

Digital tools should be used only if they:
- Provide clear professional value
- Directly support goals

---

## 8. Drain the Shallows

- Reduce shallow work (emails, meetings, reactive tasks)
- Batch communication
- Avoid constant context switching

---

## 9. Attention Residue

Switching tasks leaves residual attention behind.
Frequent task switching reduces performance quality.

---

## 10. Core Principle

Deep work is not about motivation.
It is about structured concentration.

It is a system, not a mood.
