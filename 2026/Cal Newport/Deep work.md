## 1. Core Definition

### Deep Work
Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that:
- Push cognitive capabilities to their limit
- Create new value
- Improve skill
- Are difficult to replicate

### Shallow Work
Non-cognitively demanding tasks that:
- Are logistical or reactive
- Are easily replicable
- Often performed while distracted

---

## 2. Deep Work Hypothesis

The ability to perform deep work is:

- Increasingly rare  
- Increasingly valuable  
- A key competitive advantage in the knowledge economy  

---

## 3. Why Deep Work Matters

Success depends on two abilities:

1. The ability to quickly learn hard things  
2. The ability to produce at an elite level  

Both require sustained, high-intensity focus.

---

## 4. Productivity Formula

High-Quality Work Produced  
= Time Spent × Intensity of Focus  

Focus intensity is more important than duration alone.

---

## 5. Four Philosophies of Deep Work

### 1. Monastic
- Eliminate shallow obligations
- Extreme isolation

### 2. Bimodal
- Divide time between deep focus periods and normal activity

### 3. Rhythmic
- Schedule deep work at the same time every day

### 4. Journalistic
- Enter deep work whenever opportunity appears

---

## 6. Embrace Boredom

- Deep work requires the ability to tolerate boredom
- Avoid constant digital stimulation
- Train attention instead of reacting to distractions

---

## 7. Minimize Social Media

Digital tools should be used only if they:
- Provide clear professional value
- Directly support goals

---

## 8. Drain the Shallows

- Reduce shallow work (emails, meetings, reactive tasks)
- Batch communication
- Avoid constant context switching

---

## 9. Attention Residue

Switching tasks leaves residual attention behind.
Frequent task switching reduces performance quality.

---

## 10. Core Principle

Deep work is not about motivation.
It is about structured concentration.

It is a system, not a mood.

# My Reflection (To Be Written by Me)

The author begins by arguing that, in modern society, it has become increasingly difficult to exercise deep concentration, yet such concentration is an essential condition for achieving meaningful outcomes. In contemporary life, we have grown accustomed to consuming light and fragmented knowledge through social media, which undermines sustained and reflective thinking. Moreover, algorithm-driven platforms limit exposure to diverse perspectives, narrowing the scope of thought and reducing behavioral consistency. This inconsistency, in turn, leads to lower levels of performance. While identifying these problems, the author also proposes corresponding solutions. He maintains that, over time, the ability to engage in deep work will become increasingly rare and therefore more valuable.

Ultimately, the central objective of the author is to advocate the construction of systems. Rather than relying on personal willpower or fluctuating motivation, he emphasizes the deliberate design of structural environments that naturally facilitate concentration. By controlling time, minimizing shallow tasks, and building conditions that enable sustained immersion, individuals can produce higher-quality work.

He also stresses the importance of tolerating boredom. This idea appears similar to the American marshmallow experiment, which highlights delayed gratification. From a long-term perspective, achieving higher performance requires accepting small, short-term sacrifices.

Furthermore, he argues that deep concentration is not a matter of motivation but of systems. The most effective strategy is to design one’s life so that it remains within a structured framework, minimizing the likelihood of distraction.

From my perspective, this approach seems to emphasize external structure and environmental design more than inner cultivation, which is often highlighted in certain Eastern traditions.

In conclusion, Cal Newport prioritizes the creation of structural conditions that allow focus to emerge naturally rather than relying solely on individual motivation. I intend to adopt this method by designing an environment aligned with my goals, enabling myself to approach them in a more systematic and sustainable manner.
