## What is Trade-off?

Trade-off theory is the idea that strategic success requires intentional choices — and giving something up in the process.  
Michael Porter emphasized that true strategy means deciding what **not** to do. You can’t pursue every opportunity and expect focused performance.

## My Application

- **Case:** Day 217 of no alcohol  
- **Choice:** I’ve chosen to completely avoid alcohol in order to enhance mental clarity and stay aligned with my cybersecurity and long-term goals.  
- **Insight:** Avoiding what doesn’t serve you is just as powerful as choosing what does.
