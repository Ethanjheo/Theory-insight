## 2. Chapter Summary (Brief)

Chapter 12 explores poverty and welfare from multiple theoretical and empirical perspectives. It distinguishes between absolute and relative poverty, and outlines various measurement approaches such as deprivation indices, minimum living costs, and capability metrics. It also contrasts individualistic explanations with structural critiques, and categorizes welfare states into liberal, conservative, and social democratic regimes. Key sociological concepts include de-commodification, social exclusion, underclass theory, and stratification.

## 3. Content Summary (Perspective-Based Comparison)

### A. By Relevant Countries

- **South Korea**:
  - Strong economic growth has not fully translated into social security.
  - Persistent income inequality, housing insecurity, and limited protection for irregular workers.
  - Welfare programs still heavily linked to labor market participation.

- **Australia**:
  - Broader coverage through a mixed welfare model.
  - Support includes universal healthcare and unemployment benefits.
  - Indigenous populations continue to face systemic barriers and poverty risks. Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), Indigenous health and wellbeing snapshot, 2023.

### B. By Academic Discipline

- **Sociology**:
  - Focuses on class structure, cultural deprivation, and systemic marginalization.
  - Introduces “poverty culture” and the concept of the “underclass.”

- **Economics**:
  - Uses tools like the Gini coefficient and decile comparisons to quantify inequality.
  - Discusses disposable income vs. market income, and consumption power.

- **Public Policy**:
  - Examines how welfare regimes function to reduce poverty through cash transfers, services, and rights-based access.
  - Emphasizes the state-market-family triad.

### C. Historical Comparison: South Korea vs. Australia

- **South Korea**:
  - *Past*: Minimal welfare under developmental authoritarianism.
  - *Present*: Gradual expansion of coverage, but still under market constraints.

- **Australia**:
  - *Past*: British-inspired liberalism with institutional Racism.
  - *Present*: Expanded public welfare, though debates continue over sustainability and inclusiveness.

### D. Integration with Cybersecurity Perspective

- **Risks**:
  - Welfare digitalization increases exposure to cyber threats (e.g., identity theft, phishing).
  - Disadvantaged groups with low digital literacy face greater vulnerability.

- **Policy Solutions**:
  - Secure welfare platforms with encryption and multi-factor authentication.
  - Provide digital literacy training and cybersecurity awareness for welfare recipients.
  - Strengthen regulation of public-private data handling in welfare systems.

## 5. Personal Reflection
Poverty should not be perceived merely as the result of individual shortcomings; rather, it must be understood as the outcome of a complex interplay between social, historical, cultural, economic, and structural forces. In the case of South Korea, its liberal democratic framework inherently restricts large-scale wealth redistribution, while its export-oriented economy, constrained by limited natural resources, depends heavily on human capital and global market integration.

However, the pace of economic advancement has, at times, exceeded the development of non-material dimensions such as civic values, institutional robustness, and balanced power structures. Consequently, it would be misguided for South Korea to emulate the welfare and economic models of more affluent nations without adjusting for its own socio-economic particularities. Effective welfare and development policies must be tailored to national context, grounded in both structural realism and cultural specificity.
