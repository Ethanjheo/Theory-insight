## 2. Chapter Summary (Brief)

This chapter examines the modern concept of the state, exploring its formation, theories, economic roles, and challenges under globalization. It explains how the state's authority, legitimacy, and sovereignty have evolved historically and how nation-states are being transformed under the influence of global governance and neoliberal restructuring.

## 3. Content Summary (Perspective-Based Comparison)

### a. By Relevant Countries

- **South Korea**: Experienced pseudo-state functions after liberation, followed by state-led industrialization. Elements of a predatory state emerged during rapid development through elite-capitalist alliances.
- **Western European States**: Developed welfare states based on Keynesian economics and corporatist governance models after WWII, later transitioning to neoliberal reforms post-1980s.

### b. By Academic Discipline

- **Political Science**: Focuses on authority, legitimacy, sovereignty, and the transformation of governance structures under globalization.
- **Economics**: Analyzes the shift from Keynesian mixed economies and welfare states to monetarism, neoliberal restructuring, and labor market flexibility.
- **Sociology**: Emphasizes the impact of the state on class structure, citizenship, and national identity under changing global conditions.

### c. Historical Comparison: Korea vs. Australia

| Aspect                | Korea (Past → Present)                                           | Australia (Past → Present)                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| State Structure       | Pseudo-state → Developmental State → Adaptive State              | Welfare State → Neoliberal State → Globalized Regulator    |
| Citizenship           | Limited rights → Institutionalized → Stratified by class         | Early welfare rights → Expanded → Increasing inequalities  |
| Role of Market        | State-driven industrialization → Mixed → Deregulated             | Regulated capitalism → Deregulated labor & service sectors |

### d. Security Integration Perspective

- **Potential Issue**: In a globalized governance system, weakened state sovereignty may hinder the enforcement of national cybersecurity standards. The dominance of transnational tech companies could bypass local legal frameworks.
- **Suggested Solutions**:
  - Multilateral security governance frameworks (e.g., cybersecurity treaties)
  - State–private sector cooperation in critical infrastructure protection
  - Regulating AI and data flows through internationally coordinated law

## 4. Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries

- **Beneficiaries**:
  - Transnational corporations benefiting from deregulation and market expansion
  - Political elites in predatory state structures
  - Citizens in high-capacity welfare states with strong governance adaptability

- **Non-Beneficiaries**:
  - Workers in deregulated labor markets (especially under neoliberal reforms)
  - Citizens in weak states with limited sovereignty or pseudo-state characteristics
  - Small-scale domestic industries overshadowed by global capital

## 5. Personal Reflection

One critical reason for the deepening of inequality lies in the structural shift of state functions under globalization. As states deregulate markets and retreat from welfare responsibilities, wealth and decision-making power have increasingly concentrated in transnational corporations. The labor market has become more flexible but also more precarious, resulting in wage gaps, job insecurity, and weakened collective bargaining.

Moreover, the relationship between states and global corporations is no longer hierarchical but competitive and interdependent. States can no longer act as unilateral regulators; they must negotiate and coexist with mobile capital. If corporate interests are not aligned with national policies, firms may easily relocate to more favorable jurisdictions.

This dynamic is especially critical in the design of security and GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) frameworks. State-led policies may be less enforceable in the private sector unless there is voluntary cooperation. Thus, designing GRC strategies requires a multidimensional approach that considers not only public governance structures but also the operational realities and incentives of private-sector actors. A state's cybersecurity policies must be embedded in a broader ecosystem of public–private coordination and transnational standardization.
