### c. Korea vs. Australia – Past vs. Present

| Category         | South Korea (Past → Present)                                      | Australia (Past → Present)                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Government Form  | Military regime → Representative democracy                         | British parliamentary democracy → Governance with global ties |
| Civil Society    | Suppressed activism → Active protests and civic groups             | Established institutions → Strengthened by multicultural NGOs |
| Political Model  | Elite-driven → Increasing participatory models                     | Welfare democracy → More inclusive and consultative politics  |

### d. Security Integration Perspective

- **Potential Issue**: As governance becomes more distributed, state-driven cybersecurity policies may face limitations. Global corporations, NGOs, and decentralized actors may not align with national priorities.
- **Suggested Solutions**:
  - Encourage democratic participation in security policy discussions.
  - Build multi-stakeholder governance platforms involving civil society and private sector.
  - Promote global standards for democratic cybersecurity frameworks, balancing openness with national resilience.

## 5. Personal Reflection

This chapter made clear that politics today is not just about elections or leaders—it is about how power is shared, used, and questioned. The old top-down model of government is giving way to more complex systems of governance, where states, civil society, and even corporations interact. One key insight is that states no longer have full control; they now compete and cooperate with global actors.

This creates both risks and opportunities for security governance. National cybersecurity policies may be less effective unless they reflect diverse social interests. Designing GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) strategies today means going beyond state institutions and considering how democracy functions across public and private boundaries. Democracy, to be resilient, must be participatory and integrated with evolving global realities.
