## 1. Core Concepts (Ch.7â€“12)

### A. Principality Gained by Othersâ€™ Arms & Fortuna  
- Power acquired through **external forces or allies**.  
- Fragile because loyalty lies with the benefactor, not the ruler.  
- Example: Cesare Borgiaâ€™s reliance on papal armies.  

### B. Principality Gained by VirtÃ¹  
- Strength secured through **oneâ€™s own arms, discipline, and strategy**.  
- More durable, because authority rests on internal capability.  

### C. Military Power (Ch. 12)  
- **Types of Arms:**  
  - Mercenaries: Unreliable, self-interested, dangerous.  
  - Auxiliaries: Borrowed troops from allies, equally dangerous.  
  - Oneâ€™s Own Army: Only secure foundation.  

- **Key Point:** A prince must **command his own forces**; dependence on outsiders invites ruin.

## 2. Key Takeaways
- Power granted by others is unstable; sustainable rule depends on self-reliance.  
- Military strength is the **core pillar of state power**.  
- Mercenaries and auxiliaries seem useful at first, but ultimately undermine sovereignty.

## 3. Modern Application
- **External Arms = External Capital/Investors:** Dependence on outside funding can weaken independence.  
- **Own Army = Internal Capabilities:** Building in-house teams, technology, and loyal talent ensures stability.  
- **Mercenaries = Contractors/Freelancers:** Useful in parts, but dangerous as the foundation of power.  

**Lesson:** Stability comes from what you **own and control**, not what is borrowed.

## 4. My Reflection
The essence of your writing resonates with me: building internal strength is more sustainable than relying on external support.
I recently came across an article claiming that scores in STEM subjects at the high school level in Australia have been steadily declining over the past decade.
Given that Australiaâ€™s universities and educational institutions are comparatively powerful, the high proportion of foreign students raises a concern â€” does this external dependence distract from efforts to elevate domestic capacity?
Moreover, if the nationâ€™s growth is driven primarily through skilled migration, might this undermine social cohesion over time?
Issues of ethnicity and religion may surface, potentially compromising the unity and strategic direction of the country.
