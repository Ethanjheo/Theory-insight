## 1. Core Concepts (Ch.1â€“6)

### Types of Principalities
- **Hereditary Principalities**  
  - Power passed down through family and tradition.  
  - Easier to maintain but vulnerable if the ruler becomes complacent.  

- **New Principalities**  
  - Acquired through conquest, fortune, or skill.  
  - More difficult to maintain due to instability and unfamiliarity.  

### Subtypes of New Principalities
- **Mixed Principalities**: Added to an existing territory â†’ resistance from old subjects.  
- **Entirely New Principalities**: Built from scratch â†’ requires stronger leadership.  

### Two Ways to Acquire Power
- **VirtÃ¹ (Ability, Skill, Strength)**  
  - Achieved through oneâ€™s own capability and strategy.  
  - More stable and enduring.  

- **Fortuna (Fortune, Luck)**  
  - Achieved through external help or chance.  
  - Fragile and easily lost.

## 2. Key Takeaways
- Long-standing power (hereditary) is easier to hold, but not invincible.  
- New power is unstable, but if secured by **VirtÃ¹**, it can become stronger.  
- Power gained only by **Fortuna** is fragile and unreliable.

## 3. Modern Application
- **Hereditary = Inherited wealth/network**  
- **New = Startup/entrepreneurship**  
- **VirtÃ¹ = Building success by skill**  
- **Fortuna = Windfall luck or parental support**  

**Main Lesson:** Sustainable success depends on **VirtÃ¹**, not Fortuna.

## 4. My Reflection
Reading classics often raises the question of relevance: does the wisdom of the past truly help us interpret the present and anticipate the future? Historical meaning is shaped by prevailing ideologies, and evaluation is frequently written by the victors. Thus, facts from the past cannot be applied mechanically. Yet, classics provide not certainty, but a probabilistic frameworkâ€”expanding the range of scenarios we can imagine and strengthening our ability to reason under uncertainty.

In The Prince, Machiavelli argues that VirtÃ¹ (ability) ultimately outweighs Fortuna (circumstance). While external conditions may bring opportunities closer, enduring success arises when ability surpasses luck, generating legitimacy and sustained support.

Applied to todayâ€™s world, one might question whether labor incomeâ€”grounded in effortâ€”can truly outpace the growth of capital income. Historical truths are not timeless absolutes; they must be reinterpreted through the lens of evolving social contexts.

Therefore, the value of reading classics lies not in definitive answers, but in cultivating the ability to think in terms of probabilities and expanding the spectrum of possible outcomes.
