## Day 5: Institutions, Stability, and Social Justice in Practice

### 1. Core Concept
- Rawls extends his theory from abstract principles to **practical institutions**.  
- Justice must not remain a moral ideal but be **embedded in social structures**.  
- Two principles of justice should guide:
  1. **Basic Liberties Principle** – equal rights and freedoms must be secured for all.  
  2. **Difference Principle** – inequalities are acceptable only if they benefit the least advantaged.  

---

### 2. Role of Institutions
- Institutions (law, education, healthcare, markets) must **operationalize fairness**.  
- Example:  
  - **Education** → equal opportunity regardless of family background.  
  - **Healthcare** → protect basic well-being as a condition for liberty.  
  - **Markets** → efficiency is allowed, but redistribution must correct unfair outcomes.  

---

### 3. Stability and Legitimacy
- A just society is stable not through coercion but because citizens **accept its fairness**.  
- Stability requires:  
  - Widespread agreement on fair principles (public reason).  
  - Continuous correction of structural inequalities.  
- Without fairness, even efficient systems collapse under conflict and distrust.  

---

### 4. Comparison with Utilitarianism
- **Utilitarianism**: may sacrifice minorities for aggregate welfare.  
- **Rawls’s Justice**: ensures no group is permanently disadvantaged.  
- This makes institutions not only **efficient** but also **legitimate** in the eyes of all.  

---

### 5. Critical Insight
- Justice is not only about rules but about how they are **applied in practice**.  
- Efficiency and growth matter, but only when bounded by fairness.  
- Long-term stability comes when **fair institutions generate trust**, avoiding cycles of exploitation and revolt.

### My Reflection

Rawls’s conception of fairness does not rest on the utilitarian logic of maximizing the majority’s efficiency. Instead, it focuses on guaranteeing benefits within institutions in such a way that no one is excluded. Nevertheless, the question of how this principle can be agreed upon and effectively implemented in practice remains open to critical debate.

Contemporary society often experiences intensified conflict not because of absolute deprivation, but because of relative comparisons that generate feelings of loss. For instance, Bhutan was ranked as the happiest country in the world in 2011; however, with the spread of smartphones and the internet, the increased exposure to international standards of living led to a sharp decline in its happiness index, which fell to ninety-fifth place by 2019. This example suggests that Rawls’s principle of fairness requires reinterpretation in light of the transformations brought about by modern globalization and technological change.

At the institutional level, fairness is frequently undermined. Consider the case of government bonds: they serve as instruments to attract capital for national growth. Yet while capital holders secure steady income from interest, ordinary depositors remain confined to relatively low returns on savings. Such arrangements deepen inequality and foster social conflict, which in countries such as Nepal have directly escalated into political instability.

Even so, Rawls’s fairness continues to provide an essential benchmark for addressing contemporary inequality. When institutions are designed so that all members of society benefit, fairness becomes not merely an abstract ideal but a practical principle for resolving social problems.

In conclusion, Rawls’s conception of fairness must be reinterpreted in the context of modern structural inequalities such as wealth disparity. Nevertheless, it remains a crucial foundation for sustaining social trust and ensuring the legitimacy of just institutions.
