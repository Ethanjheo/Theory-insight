## Day 1: Core Principles of Justice as Fairness  

### 1. Justice as Fairness
- Rawls frames justice not as utility maximization but as **fair terms of cooperation**.  
- The central goal is to establish principles that **everyone would agree to** if they were free and equal.  

---

### 2. Social Contract Tradition
- Builds on Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant.  
- The idea: legitimate institutions arise from an **agreement among equals**, not from force or tradition.  
- Institutions are “just” if people would consent to them **under fair conditions**.  

---

### 3. Veil of Ignorance
- **Original Position**: a thought experiment where individuals design rules without knowing their class, wealth, gender, or talents.  
- This “veil” ensures impartiality, preventing self-serving bias.  
- Under this veil, people tend to choose principles that **protect the least advantaged**, since anyone could end up in that position.  

---

### 4. Fairness and Inequality
- Rawls acknowledges natural and social inequalities exist.  
- **Core idea**: Inequalities are only just if they (a) benefit society as a whole, and (b) improve the condition of the least advantaged.

### Personal Reflection

In the consumer society of the 21st century, people tend to organize their thinking around practicality. What is considered "practical" often appears rational, yet it inevitably generates opportunity costs. As a result, individual decisions are naturally oriented toward maximizing the efficiency of the majority. However, the critical question remains: can such efficiency truly be justified under the principles of social justice?  

Rawls’ theory offers two stimulating perspectives. First, a social institution must serve the well-being of society as a whole. Second, inequality can only be justified if it benefits the least advantaged. These two criteria provide a valuable lens through which to assess state policies before approaching them with criticism.  

Admittedly, it is difficult in reality to accommodate every group simultaneously. Yet even if such principles seem idealistic, taking them as fundamental premises can significantly alter the purpose and direction of policymaking.
