## Day 2: The Two Principles of Justice  

### 1. Core Concept
Rawls articulates two central principles of justice, chosen under the "veil of ignorance" in the original position:  

1. **Equal Basic Liberties Principle**  
   - Each person has an equal right to the most extensive set of basic liberties compatible with a similar system for all.  
   - Examples: freedom of speech, political participation, freedom of conscience, protection of the person and property.  

2. **Difference Principle & Fair Equality of Opportunity**  
   - Social and economic inequalities are permissible only if:  
     a) They are attached to positions open to all under conditions of **fair equality of opportunity**.  
     b) They work to the greatest benefit of the **least advantaged members** of society.

### 2. Structured Differences
- **Equal Liberties** (non-negotiable, priority rule)  
  - Cannot be sacrificed for efficiency or greater welfare.  
  - Freedom is a foundation, not a commodity to trade.  

- **Difference Principle** (conditional)  
  - Inequality is tolerated only if it improves conditions for those at the bottom.  
  - Example: Higher salaries for doctors are justified if they also improve healthcare access for the poor.

### 3. Implications
- Justice is not about maximizing total welfare (utilitarianism) but about ensuring **fairness**.  
- The two principles are **lexically ordered**: liberty first, then inequality adjustment.  
- Policy-making must always ask:  
  - Does this policy protect equal liberties?  
  - If it creates inequality, does it still benefit the least advantaged?

### 4. Personal Reflection
There is a need to first clarify what is meant by social justice. John Rawls’s theory of justice emphasizes not the maximization of majority efficiency, but the pursuit of benefits that all members of society could reasonably endorse—what he terms comprehensive legitimacy. The crucial point is that justice does not consist in demanding the sacrifice of certain individuals; rather, it is secured when everyone, including the individual, stands to gain—a genuine win–win structure.

The difficulty arises when the interests of a few appear larger than those of the many. In authoritarian regimes (e.g., China, Russia, North Korea), rulers may achieve national development while simultaneously reaping disproportionate benefits. Can this be called justice? From Rawls’s perspective, such arrangements could not be agreed upon behind the veil of ignorance, as political freedom and equal rights of participation are absent. Hence, they cannot be considered just.

In conclusion, justice is not reducible to efficiency or the logic of majority rule. It requires that everyone benefit, with particular attention to the well-being of the least advantaged. Moreover, the principles of justice must be those that could be fairly chosen within the thought experiment of the veil of ignorance. Only then do they carry genuine social legitimacy.
