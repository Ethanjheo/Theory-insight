## Day 2: The Two Principles of Justice  

### 1. Core Concept
Rawls articulates two central principles of justice, chosen under the "veil of ignorance" in the original position:  

1. **Equal Basic Liberties Principle**  
   - Each person has an equal right to the most extensive set of basic liberties compatible with a similar system for all.  
   - Examples: freedom of speech, political participation, freedom of conscience, protection of the person and property.  

2. **Difference Principle & Fair Equality of Opportunity**  
   - Social and economic inequalities are permissible only if:  
     a) They are attached to positions open to all under conditions of **fair equality of opportunity**.  
     b) They work to the greatest benefit of the **least advantaged members** of society.

### 2. Structured Differences
- **Equal Liberties** (non-negotiable, priority rule)  
  - Cannot be sacrificed for efficiency or greater welfare.  
  - Freedom is a foundation, not a commodity to trade.  

- **Difference Principle** (conditional)  
  - Inequality is tolerated only if it improves conditions for those at the bottom.  
  - Example: Higher salaries for doctors are justified if they also improve healthcare access for the poor.

### 3. Implications
- Justice is not about maximizing total welfare (utilitarianism) but about ensuring **fairness**.  
- The two principles are **lexically ordered**: liberty first, then inequality adjustment.  
- Policy-making must always ask:  
  - Does this policy protect equal liberties?  
  - If it creates inequality, does it still benefit the least advantaged?

### 4. Personal Reflection
Rawls’ framework forces us to rethink the meaning of fairness.  
In modern societies, efficiency often dominates as a guiding principle. Yet Rawls reminds us that **justice cannot be reduced to aggregate gains**. What matters is how the structure treats its most vulnerable members.  

This perspective resonates with contemporary debates: whether in taxation, healthcare, or housing, the question is not just “how much wealth we create,” but also **“who truly benefits?”**
