## Day 3: The Original Position & the Veil of Ignorance

### 1. Core Concept
- Rawls introduces the **original position**: a hypothetical situation where individuals choose principles of justice.  
- In this state, participants are behind a **veil of ignorance**:  
  - They do not know their class, wealth, gender, race, abilities, or social position.  
  - This ignorance ensures impartiality, as no one can design principles to favor their own situation.  

---

### 2. Function of the Veil
- **Neutralizes bias**: prevents policies favoring the rich, powerful, or privileged.  
- **Forces fairness**: since one could end up in any social position, rational individuals would adopt principles protecting even the weakest.  
- **Justifies the two principles of justice** introduced in Day 2 (basic liberties + difference principle).  

---

### 3. Implications
- The veil of ignorance makes Rawls’s theory more robust than utilitarianism:  
  - Utilitarianism allows sacrifice of the minority for majority happiness.  
  - Rawls’s framework forbids this, since one might be in the minority.  
- The original position is not a real historical event but a **thought experiment** that legitimizes fairness.  

---

### 4. Critical Insight
- Justice is not just efficiency or majority rule; it must be **acceptable to all** when stripped of personal advantage.  
- The veil is a **moral filter** that ensures principles are chosen without bias, leading to **social legitimacy**.

### My Reflection
Rawls’s conception of social justice criticizes utilitarianism and centers on the guarantee of basic liberties and the principle of difference under a framework of equality.

He argued that although utilitarianism may provide efficiency for the majority, it fails to ensure fairness for minorities. Rawls did not accept the idea that the values of the majority inherently outweigh those of the minority.

For Rawls, basic liberties arise from the “veil of ignorance.” In other words, they are original rights granted equally to all, regardless of personal disposition or social environment. He further emphasized the difference principle, which seeks to protect minority rights and ensures that the benefits generated by the majority must also extend to the least advantaged.

However, Rawls’s theory of justice faces challenges in practice. The persistent gap between capital owners and laborers highlights the tension between theory and reality. Yet Rawls suggested that inequality can only be justified if it occurs within the broader trajectory of social development and ultimately benefits the least advantaged members of society.

In conclusion, Rawls’s theory represents a realistic framework that simultaneously pursues social progress and the protection of minority rights. By addressing the shortcomings of utilitarianism, it provides an alternative path toward the realization of collective well-being.
