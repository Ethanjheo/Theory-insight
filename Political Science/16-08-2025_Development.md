## Chapter Summary (Brief)
This chapter examines the rise of Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs), the tension between dependent and autonomous development, and how post-World War II ideological divisions shaped economic growth. It emphasizes the concept of “peripheral Fordism” and highlights rare cases of successful dependency reversal, particularly South Korea and Taiwan.

## Content Summary (Perspective-Based Comparison)

### By Relevant Countries
- **South Korea & Taiwan**: Benefited from U.S. security and financial support, pursued state-led industrialization, disciplined private enterprises, and invested heavily in technological learning.  
- **Latin America**: Continued dependency on raw material exports with limited industrial diversification.  
- **Western Europe**: Maintained global influence but lagged behind East Asia in semiconductor and ICT industries.  

### By Academic Discipline
- **Economics**: Interprets development through dependency theory, world-systems analysis, and late industrialization models.  
- **Political Science**: Focuses on state intervention, corporate regulation, and Cold War geopolitical alignments.  
- **Sociology**: Analyzes unequal global structures, labor exploitation, and the persistence of core–periphery dynamics.  

### Past vs. Present (South Korea and Australia)
- **South Korea (Past)**: Dependent on U.S. aid, specialized in labor-intensive exports, and gradually transitioned into heavy industries.  
- **South Korea (Present)**: A leading player in ICT and semiconductors, though challenged by innovation demands and social inequality.  
- **Australia (Past)**: Resource exporter tied to Britain and global markets with minimal industrial diversification.  
- **Australia (Present)**: Still resource-dependent (iron ore, coal, LNG) but increasingly concerned with sustainability, climate policy, and digital security.  

### Security-Convergent Thinking (Problems & Solutions)
- **Problems**:  
  - Export-driven industries face risks of cyber espionage, IP theft, and supply chain disruptions.  
  - Dependence on globalized production networks increases vulnerability to systemic cyberattacks.  
- **Solutions**:  
  - Strengthen Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) frameworks.  
  - Invest in national R&D for cybersecurity resilience.  
  - Establish regional cooperation on supply chain and cyber defense.

## Beneficiaries vs. Non-Beneficiaries
- **Beneficiaries**: South Korea, Taiwan, export-oriented conglomerates, industries achieving global competitiveness.  
- **Non-Beneficiaries**: Resource-dependent nations, economies locked into primary exports, and laborers in low-wage export zones.

## Personal Reflection
Post-war development was shaped by ideological rivalry between democracy and socialism, resulting in a global system of dependent development. Peripheral states were integrated into an international division of labor, fostering selective industrialization but also reinforcing structural inequality.  

For developing countries, two lessons emerge:  
1. External alliances are often necessary to initiate industrial growth.  
2. Long-term success requires building autonomous industries with global competitiveness.  

The few success stories, such as South Korea and Taiwan, underscore the importance of **state-led capitalism**—government intervention, corporate regulation, diversification, and sustained technological learning. Most latecomer states, however, remain in dependency traps, highlighting the difficulty of reversing structural subordination without robust state guidance and institutional capacity.
